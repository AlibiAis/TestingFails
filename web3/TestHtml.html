In 2012, the Neighbourhood released the EP I'm Sorry..., featuring such singles as "Sweater Weather" and "Female Robbery." The songs gained considerable attention online and helped build interest in the group. By 2013, "Sweater Weather" had topped the Billboard Alternative chart and solidified the group's buzzworthy status.I Love You
Two more EPs followed in 2013, leading up to the release of their full-length debut I Love You. Buoyed by the continued interest in "Sweater Weather," as well as the single "Afraid," the album peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200 and number five on the Top Alternative Albums chart. The following year, the group's long-delayed mixtape album, #000000 & #FFFFFF, appeared as a free download online. Included on the album was the single "icanteven," featuring French Montana</font></p>
